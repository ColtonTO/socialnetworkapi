## Description
The socialnetworkAPI app is a backend API that serves as the foundation for a social networking platform. It provides a set of RESTful endpoints that allow users to perform various actions, such as creating an account, creating and deleting posts, and adding and removing friends.
The API is built using Node.js and the Express.js framework, and uses MongoDB as its database. It provides a secure authentication system, which allows users to create an account with a unique email address and password, and generates an encrypted token that is used to authenticate and authorize the user's subsequent requests.
The socialnetworkAPI app is designed to be scalable and customizable, and can be easily integrated into a front-end application to provide a complete social networking experience.

## Usage
